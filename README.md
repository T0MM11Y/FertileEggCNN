🔍 Overview
Egg Classifier is a mobile application built with Flutter that leverages on-device machine learning to classify egg quality into different grades. By utilizing edge computing technology, all processing happens locally on the device, ensuring:

Privacy: Images are never transmitted to external servers
Speed: Classification results in 1-3 seconds
Offline Functionality: Works without internet connection
Cost Efficiency: No server costs or maintenance required
🏗 Architecture
The application follows a clean architecture approach with the following components:
